# Tweetify - Fullstack Webapplication

Tweetify is a personal project being built to further practice JavaScript. The frontend is currently built with React.js, Material UI and Redux. The backend is built with Node.js, Express and Firebase. I'm using Firebase for managing authentication, file storage and NoSQL Database.
